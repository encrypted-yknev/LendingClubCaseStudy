# Lending Club Case Study using EDA
> This case study mainly involves studying the loan data issued by company between the years 2007 - 2011 using exploratory data analysis (EDA). We will develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in finance services and enable the lenders to make better decisions to lend money so that the risk of losing the money can be minimised to a larger extent.
> The main objective of this case study is to identify patterns to check if a person is likely to default on laons. Using this analysis the company can take important decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate.
